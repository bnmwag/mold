# Mold™

A modern starter template for designers, developers, and digital makers.

Mold was built to speed up the process what i do for basically every project.

It represents a clean starting point for building high-end, visually rich websites using NextJS and PayloadCMS at the core. the rest is kinda my personal preference and can be changed to your liking.
